# Python Environment

A Python environment is a separate and isolated workspace for Python projects. It allows you to manage dependencies, versions, and packages without conflicts across different projects.

## Why Use Python Environments?

Suppose you have two projects:
- `project1` uses FastAPI 1.4
- `project2` uses FastAPI 2.0

If FastAPI 2.0 is installed globally, `project1` may not work properly because it requires FastAPI 1.4. By using virtual environments, each project can have its own set of installed packages and dependencies, independent of whatâ€™s installed globally or in other environments.

## Benefits

- Isolates project dependencies
- Prevents version conflicts
- Simplifies package management

## Steps to Create a Python Environment (Windows)

1. **Open your VS Code terminal.**
2. **Create a new environment:**
	```powershell
	python -m venv environment_name
	```
3. **Activate the environment:**
	```powershell
	.\environment_name\Scripts\Activate.ps1
	```
	*(For Command Prompt, use: `environment_name\Scripts\activate.bat`)*
4. **Deactivate the environment:**
	```powershell
	deactivate
	```
